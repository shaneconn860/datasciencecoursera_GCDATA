# Getting_cleaning_data_R

## This is the repository for the final project task for the Getting and Cleaning Data module

The main script is called `run_analysis.R` and does the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The `codebook.md` file contains a description of what each section of code achieves in the script

The file `new_data2.txt` is the output of the main script
